# 1. MIT License

来自麻省理工的高端许可证：

A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.

内容：较为宽松，仅署名即可，github上经常用。

示例：

```

# 2.Creative Commons(知识共享)

## 2.1 CC BY

This license lets others distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

署名就对了。

## 2.2 CC BY-SA

This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.

署名，并且强制以相同方式共享。

（我开源，你也必须开源）

## 2.3 CC BY-ND

This license lets others reuse the work for any purpose, including commercially; however, it cannot be shared with others in adapted form, and credit must be provided to you.

署名，并且禁止演绎。

（想改我代码？没门）

## 2.4 CC BY-NC

This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.

署名，严禁用于商业用途

## 2.5 CC BY-NC-SA

This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

署名，非商业，相同方式共享

（大家一起排列组合啊！）

## 2.6 CC BY-NC-ND

号称CC中最严的条款。

署名，非商业，禁止修改。

# 3. MPL 2.0（Mozilla Public License）

Permissions of this weak copyleft license are conditioned on making available source code of licensed files and modifications of those files under the same license (or in certain cases, one of the GNU licenses). Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger work using the licensed work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for files added in the larger work.

所有自己原创的可以自己选择开源或闭源。作者的原始文件必须保持原有协议不变。

# 4. GPL v3

Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights.

许可证必须不变。。

# 5. Apache 2

A permissive license whose main conditions require preservation of copyright and license notices. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.

有点像GPL，但加入一条：必须标明哪些地方修改过。

# 6. BSL（Boost Software License 1.0）

A simple permissive license only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices for source (and not binary) distribution. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.

有点像CC BY。

# 总结：

开源许可证具有的法律效力有限，严格来说它并非法律文本，全靠使用者的自觉。但这一点在西方国家中较为受重视，所以在自己的一些项目中详细说明自己的引用以及加入开源许可证是必要的，这样可以防止一些人利用你的项目从事商业经营却不付版权费，也可以避免不必要的纠纷。

总之，开源许可证并不能约束别人的行为，但可以减少纠纷。
